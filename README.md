          Twin-Hex Cipher Encoder/Decoder

usage: twin_cipher.py [-h] [-d] [-e] [text]

options:
  -d, --decode  Decode Twin-Hex
  -e, --encode  Encode to Twin-Hex
```

### What is Twin-Hex Cipher:
 In Twin-Hex Cipher, the original text gets converted into two characters at a time. I know nothing more. Check out [their website](https://www.calcresult.com/misc/cyphers/twin-hex.html)

### Usage:

Simply **clone the repository**. Only python should be installed in your system.
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/htr-tech/0xTwin
$ cd 0xTwin

# For encoding text
$ python twin_cipher.py -e "FLAG{THIS_IS_TWIN_CIPHER}"

# For decoding ciphertext
$ python twin_cipher.py -d "2uk2h36s42zt3tr32r4pg43t3gf2mh3l42s26w0"
```

### Why this Github Repo??
 Recently i have been participating in some CTFs. In one event I got this cipher & there was no decoder available on Github. 
 
 So, I just translated the functions from `calcresult.com` in python for offline usage.
